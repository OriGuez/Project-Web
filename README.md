React Web App.

We splitted our work at first to register and login pages, and later to home and video pages, created components to items like the navbar, video-add and different sections in the site like comment section and etc.

We designd our site with a uniform design with a lot of attention to the small details. We used react-icons/fa libary for icons.

By clicking on your user image in home page you will see information about your user and an option to sign out.

By clicking on the brand logo from any page on our site you will be redirected to home page.
